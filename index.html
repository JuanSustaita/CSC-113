        <p>
            My name is Juan Sustaita, and this is the third repository I have ever made so I’m still quite new to this.<br>
            I am currently going for my associate’s degree in computer Programming and plan on coming back to FTCC for another Degree when I'm done with this one.<br>
            I'm not entirely sure on what that is going to be, but it's either going to be for my electrical license or for automotive mechanic.
